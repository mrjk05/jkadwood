The best 11 players that the coach thinks will achieve the outcome of the game for that specific team they are playing against (usually to win).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starting 11 can be dynamic and is picked from a squad of players. The squad can (and usually does) contain up to 30 individuals all vying for the opportunity to be picked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nice tension within the squad. Players naturally want to be picked in a starting squad. It gives them pride. It’s fun to play rather than just sit on the bench. It’s an opportunity to showcase their skills and talents not just to their immediate team, but the wider world. The more a player is able to play consistently well, the higher the impact and value to their career and the team they are playing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a starting team and a bench is not actually foreign to business. It’s very normal to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-careers/what-does-on-the-bench-mean-in-consulting&quot;&gt;this concept occur in management consulting&lt;/a&gt;. Growing a squad is important to ensure freshness and optimal performance on any particular task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where formations and starting 11’s come into play. As a coach, picking your starting 11 and the formation you want to play is one of the most important (if not the most important) strategic decisions you have full control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many different formations in football. All serve different purposes and outcomes. Some are more attack minded. Some are more defensive. Some enable high speed. While others centre on possession.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jins</name></author><category term="high performance" /><category term="product management" /><category term="engineering management" /><summary type="html">When a football ⚽️ team runs out onto the pitch, the coach or team manager has to pick a “starting 11”.
